# Cryptography-Decryption
Cryptography, or cryptology, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. &amp;In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.
